      <div class="temptext">Hey. I'm in the middle of a few time-consuming projects right now, so this has to go on the backburner for the time being. You can reach my Github <a href="https://github.com/WalkerNash">HERE</a> and my LinkedIn profile <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dallas-walker-peterson-8383bb44/">HERE</a>; I'll be getting back to finishing the design on this as soon as I can. I look forward to hearing from you!</div>
